## Safari City — Early Funnel Insights

### What the data suggests (from the example cohort in the notebook)
- Install → Open: healthy step-down; title Play CTA is clear (context DAU trend is stable).
- Tutorial Complete: ~92% from title to tutorial complete in the sample (≥85% target). Minimal friction.
- L1 Win (First Key): ~94% from tutorial to first win. Early boards are beatable, good momentum.
- Spend First Key: ~95% of players who earned a key spend it quickly; a small gap implies some discoverability delay.
- Reach L3: the largest early drop (~10–12% from previous). Likely from out-of-moves modals or rising difficulty.
- Milestone 1 → Episode 1: another meaningful drop (~19%). Pacing fatigue if too many micro tasks precede the “big reveal.”
- Engagement pattern you observed: ~3 free boosters over ~10–12 early levels (≈25–30% of levels) — good for momentum, but grants should be spaced and purposeful (teach or rescue) rather than trivialize.

Top 3 drop-offs (sample):
1) Reach L3 (Loop Mastery) — biggest early friction after onboarding.
2) Milestone 1 Reached → Episode 1 Complete — pacing/payoff gap.
3) L1 Win → Spend First Key — small but important; preserves the earn→reward link.

### Likely causes
- Out of Moves/“Don’t Give Up” modal choices causing session ends when continues feel pay-gated.
- Key award feedback slightly delayed after win, weakening the cause–effect learning.
- Boosters offered but not contextually taught; some players rely on them instead of learning board mechanics.
- Many small renovation steps before a strong visual payoff can dilute excitement.

### Recommendations (prioritized)
1) Smooth L2–L3 difficulty and protect early continues
   - Guarantee ad-continue on 2nd fail in L2–L4; defer gem continues until post‑Episode 1.
   - Target win rates without boosters: L1 ≥90%, L2 ≥85%, L3 ≥80%.

2) Make the first key spend instant and obvious
   - On L1 win, immediately animate a key pop and increment; auto‑pan camera to the task with a pulsing spend target.
   - Success metric: ≥95% spend within 60s; reduce earn→spend gap.

3) Structure free booster grants to teach and rescue (not trivialize)
   - Placement: one tutorial grant (L1–L2), one safety grant on 2nd fail (L3–L4), one celebratory grant at first milestone.
   - Track win‑lift with vs without booster; if lift >15 pts on L2–L3, soften boards.

4) Increase meaning of early payoffs
   - Bundle 2–3 micro tasks into a “big reveal” every ~5 minutes; add short narrative beats.
   - KPI: raise Milestone→Episode‑1 conversion and average session length without increasing fails.

5) Post‑Episode‑1 monetization ramp
   - Swap some free grants for rewarded ads; introduce a value‑focused starter pack after the first big reveal.
   - Personalize offers for booster‑reliant players; keep Beginners/Stuck focused on ad‑continues and tips.

### Metrics to monitor after changes
- Conversion by stage (especially L2–L3 and Milestone→Episode 1).
- Key spend latency (earn→spend ≤ 60s, 95%+ of players).
- Continue modal outcomes: ad vs gems vs end; rage‑quits.
- Booster grant rate by level and win‑rate lift with/without booster.
- D1 retention segmented by Beginners, Stuck, Fast, Booster‑Reliant.

### Top Drop-offs

- Milestone 1 Reached: 23.5% drop from previous stage
- Episode 1 Complete (D0): 19.2% drop from previous stage
- Reach L3 (Loop Mastery): 10.5% drop from previous stage

### KPIs

- Tutorial completion: 92.4% (target ≥ 85%)
- Earned key but not spent immediately: ~400 players
- D0 Episode 1 completion: 42.0%

### Recommendations

- Bundle small tasks into a bigger reveal; grant free booster at milestone.
- Add cliffhanger and D1 notification with next-goal CTA.
- Smooth early difficulty; offer ad-continue on 2nd fail instead of gem paywall.
